# InsTerra

A collection of repositories that serve as learning data for `upmaru/insterra` project. Insterra learns and indexes, labels the contents of these repositories to build a library of `block` and `presets` that can be utilized by users of `upmaru/instellar`. It is recommended that each repository contains the maximum possibilities of the modules available to be learned by the algorithm.

## Format

The configuration format should be `tf.json` variant since they're going to be read by the machine.
