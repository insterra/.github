# InsTerra

A collection of template repositories that serve as a starting point for terraform scripts. We anticipate this to grow with all the customizations and configurations possible.

Ideally you can just use a single template, and update your repository with changes as needed. Each repository just serves as a starting point depending on what kind of infrastructure you want to have.
